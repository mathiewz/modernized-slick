/**
 * A transition that will combine two states into one effect. The first state is
 * the one we're transitioning from. The second state is specified in the constructor.
 *
 * By default one state will simply be rendered over the other. Subclass this transition
 * overriding the preRenderFirstState and preRenderSecondState to setup the rendering
 * for each state (alpha or what ever). Note that it's also possible to use the
 * postRenderSecondState method to clean up your OpenGL setup.
 *
 * So these methods are called like so:
 *
 * preRenderFirstState()
 * = the first state is rendered
 * preRenderSecondState()
 * = the second state is rendered
 * postRenderSecondState()
